<p style="color:tomato;">Covid-19 has made it so that we can't do some summer activities we'd usually do, such as~</p>
<ul>
	<li>Going to a water park</li>
    <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
    <li>Going to a playground</li>
    <li>Having a picnic</li>
    <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>However, we still can do things that can be done inside/near your house or without much contact to anyone else. One of these things is...Biking! </p>

<h3 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> One of the summer activites that I've done this year is going biking.</h3>
<dl>

<dt>I like going biking (although that might just be because I like being able to go outside of the house now and then).</dt>
<dd>- I tend to go on a bike ride everyday around the evening, along with my brother (and sometimes one of his friends) We just go on a short quick ride around the neighborhood. </dd>
</dl>

<p><b> I enjoy doing this because it allows me to go outside (safely) and do some "excersize", while also being fun!</b> </p>
